# test-infra

Nephio's `test-infra` repository contains an Ansible playbook used for deploying Nephio.

Although the playbook includes an option to disable KinD, this feature is not functioning correctly as of May 2024.

Therefore, we have removed the KinD installation option from the Ansible playbook and maintained this repository.
